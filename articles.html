                    <p>             Over decades of coaching and consulting to thousands of executives in a
                      variety of industries, however, my colleagues and I have come across
                       people who succeed at this kind of learning. We’ve identified four 
                       attributes they have in spades: aspiration, self-awareness, curiosity,
                        and vulnerability. They truly want to understand and master new skills;
                        they see themselves very clearly; they constantly think of and ask good questions;
                        and they tolerate their own mistakes as they move up the learning curve.


                        ASPIRATION:
                        It’s easy to see aspiration as either there or not: 
                        You want to learn a new skill or you don’t; you have
                        ambition and motivation or you lack them. But great
                        learners can raise their aspiration level—and that’s
                        key, because everyone is guilty of sometimes resisting
                        development that is critical to success. </p>

                    <p>              Effective learning often boils down to a type of project management.
                        In order to develop an area of expertise, we first have to set 
                        achievable goals about what we want to learn. Then we have to develop
                        strategies to help us reach those goals.
                    
                        A targeted approach to learning helps us cope with all the nagging feelings
                        associated with gaining expertise: Am I good enough? Will I fail? What if I’m wrong? 
                        Isn’t there something else that I’d rather be doing?
                    
                    While some self-carping is normal, Stanford psychologist Albert Bandura says these sorts 
                    of negative emotions can quickly rob us of our ability to learn something new. Plus, 
                    we’re more committed if we develop a plan with clear objectives. The research is
                     overwhelming on this point. Studies consistently show that people
                      with clear goals outperform people with vague aspirations like “do a good job.”
                       By setting targets, people can manage their feelings more easily and 
                       achieve progress with their learning. </p>
